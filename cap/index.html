It states that a distributed data store can simultaneously provide at most two out of three guarantees: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance. This means that in the event of a network partition, you must choose to sacrifice either Consistency or Availability.`,

What it means: All nodes in the distributed system will have the same, most up-to-date view of the data at any given moment. If you write a piece of data to one node, and then immediately read it from another node, you are guaranteed to get the very latest version. Analogy: Imagine a shared document. With strong consistency, if one person saves changes, everyone else sees those changes immediately. No one will ever see an outdated version. Impact of choice: To ensure consistency during a partition, nodes that cannot communicate with the "source of truth" (or the majority of the system) might stop accepting writes or even reads, effectively becoming unavailable.`,

What it means: The system is always operational and responsive to requests. Every query made to the system will receive a response, whether it's the requested data or an indication that the operation failed. The system does not hang or return an error just because of a temporary internal issue (like a network partition). Analogy: A website is available if it always loads and shows something to the user, even if that "something" might be slightly old data. Impact of choice: To ensure availability during a partition, different parts of the system might continue to operate independently, potentially leading to inconsistencies if writes happen on both sides of the partition.`,
